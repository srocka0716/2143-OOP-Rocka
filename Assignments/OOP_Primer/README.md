## Definitions


#### Abstraction
>Abstraction refers to essentially what is behind the scenes of a method. A programmer doesn't need to know what pow() is doing, just that is does it, 
>so this is hidden to simplify the function.


#### Attributes / Properties
> Attributes or properties are the data that is associated with an object.


#### Class
> A class is essentially the blueprints and instructions to create objects that consist of attributes and methods.
> Using classes is a way to ensure encapsulation.

#### Class Variable
> A variable that belongs to a class instead of the instances or objects of the class/


#### Composition
> Composition essentially is the combining of two or more objects to make a more complex object. This is often
> used in place of inheritance as it doesn't just make a class from inheriting an above class, but instead
> creates a new class that is contrived of multiple other classes.
>

#### Constructor
> A special method or function that is automatically called when an object is created. The constructor
> initializes the objects initial attributes.

#### Encapsulation
> Encapsulation is the protecting of data by bundling the data and the methods that work on that
> data within a class.

#### Friends
> The friend keyword is used when you want to give a method or a class access to the
> private and protected members to the class it is made friends of.

#### Inheritance
> Inheritance is an OOP technique that allows one class to inherit the attributes and methods
> of another class.

#### Instance Variable
> An instance variable is one that is defined within a class and associated with each instance
> or object of the class.
>
#### Member Variable
>A member variable is used interchangably with instance variable.

#### Method
> A method is a function that is held within a class that can manipulate an object from that class's
> data. Methods can have different levels of securtity using the keywords "public," "private," or "protected."
>
#### Multiple Inheritance
> Multiple Inheritance is an OOP concept that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from more than
> one class. 
>

#### Object
> An objet is one single instance of data that is allowed to use the methods inside of a class.
>
#### Overloading
> Overloading is the ability to define multiple functions or methods with the same name but different
> parameter lists so that you can call them without errors. The compiler can tell the difference between
> each function based on the arguments that are passed to the function.

#### Polymorphism
> Polymorphism describes how methods can be used in an overloaded way to best
> fit the programmers needs.
>
#### Public / Private / Protected
> Public, private, and protected are access modifiers that control that accessibility of class
> members like methods and attributes.
- Private members are only accessible through the same class.
- Public members are accessible through out the entire program.
- Protected memember are accessible within the same class and its subclasses.

#### Static
> Static refers to something that is shared across all instances of a class.
>
#### Virtual
> Virtual refers to a method that can be overridden in a subclass. This helps with polymorphism.
